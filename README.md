# Finger-Counter
A real-time finger counting system built using **OpenCV, Python and Mediapipe**. The project uses a webcam feed to detect a hand and count the number of fingers raised, displaying the output on the screen.
## Features
- Real-time hand detection using webcam
- Counts number of raised fingers accurately
- Visualizes hand landmarks and count
- Lightweight and easy to run on most systems

## How it works
- The webcam captures video in real time.
- The frame is passed through MediaPipeâ€™s Hand Tracking solution.
- Landmarks are analyzed to determine which fingers are raised.
- The number of fingers raised is displayed on screen.
The demo for the same has been attached
